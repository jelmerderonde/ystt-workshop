    "Briefly explained, a perceptron is a simple neural network that has $I$ inputs. All $I$ inputs are connected to a single output. The $I$ connection weights, are trained to ensure that the output is activated whenever the inputs contain certain patterns. In our example, we train 10 perceptrons simultaneously on the same input to recognize handwritten digits '0' to '9'. Each perceptron takes care of detecting one of the digits; their output should become activated whenever one of the digits '0' to '9' appears in the input. The 10 outputs of the perceptrons are normalized to sum to one, so that their indivisual values can be interpreted as probabilities. The output with the largest probability given a certain input is the classification of the input. \n",
