    "Each \"cell\" of the notebook (a rectangular area) contains either explanatory text (\"Markdown,\" like this cell) or Python/Keras commands (\"Code\"). By clicking on this cell, you select it (and the contours are highlighted). If you press \"__Run__\" in the menu, Jupyter processes the contents of this cell and moves on to the next. Scroll to the next cell, read the command and press __Run__ again. The result of the command (if any) will become visible. Just proceed through the notebook in this fashion, and return to previous cells, whenever necessary (either to re-read an explanation or command, or to change parameters). Please note that if you want to restart the entire notebook, you have to start at the top.\n",
